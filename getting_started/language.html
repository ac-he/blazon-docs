        <h3>Statements</h3>
        <div class="image-side-by-side">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Every statement takes the form of the blazon for one coat of arms. Different types of statement are
                    created by
                    different <a href="/blazon-docs/logic">divisions of the field</a>, and the values and parameters of
                    the statement
                    correspond to each of the divisions present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the right is an example statement. The division of <span style="font-style: italic;">Per fess; at
                        center an escutcheon</span> represents an
                    <a href="/blazon-docs/logic/arithmetic#two-variables" target="_blank">arithmetic operation involving
                        two variables</a>.
                    In this case, the variables are represented by the two crowns in chief and the three crowns in base,
                    as detailed in the next section.
                    The operation (in this case, division) is controlled by the color of the escutcheon.
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="/blazon-docs/assets/arithmetic/example3.png">
        </div>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
            All statement blazons contain one or more values. These are described in terms of their
            <a href="/blazon-docs/design/tinctures" target="_blank">tincture</a> and their <a
                href="/blazon-docs/design/charges" target="_blank">charges</a>.
            Depending on the division in question, the value will be interpreted different ways. Some divisions, like
            the escutcheon
            in the example above, use tincture to specify which operation to use. Others, like the base and chief of the
            example above,
            use the type of charge and the number of charges to represent a particular number.
        </p>
        <h4>Finding the Value</h4>
        <div class="image-side-by-side">
            <img src="/blazon-docs/assets/charge_chart/lion_rampant.png">
            <img src="/blazon-docs/assets/branching/example5.png">
            <img src="/blazon-docs/assets/charge_chart/chequy.png">
            <div>
                <p>
                    To the left are several examples of fields bearing charges. Each charge carries a certain numerical
                    value.
                    For some charges, this value can be squared or cubed by including the charge two or three times
                    within the
                    same division. (Note that charges such as <span style="font-style: italic;">chequy</span>, shown
                    below,
                    don't support this.)
                </p>
                <script id="charge-evaluation-script-0" src="/blazon-docs/logic/charge_calculation.js" async
                    type="module" data-charge-0="Lion Rampant" data-quantity-0="1" data-charge-1="Fleur-de-Lis"
                    data-quantity-1="3" data-charge-2="Chequy" data-quantity-2="1">
                    </script>
                <p>
                    Thus, the values of these three fields are 10, 216, and 1000 respectively.
                </p>

        <h4>Variable, Branch Label, or Number?</h4>
        <div class="image-side-by-side">
            <div>
                <p>
                    In the Blazon Programming Language, all variable and branch names are integers in disguise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The values shown above, if used as variables, could be thought of as Variable10, Variable216, and
                    Variable1000.
                    In reality, a field without divisions represets a <a href="/blazon-docs/logic/branching#label"
                        target="_blank">
                        branch label</a>, so these would represent the starts of Branch10, Branch216, and Branch1000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that the same value can be reached in a number of ways. For instance, there
                    are five ways
                    to describe the integer 9.
                </p>
                <script id="charge-evaluation-script-1" src="/blazon-docs/logic/charge_calculation.js" async type="module" 
                    data-charge-0="Mullet" data-quantity-0="2"          data-charge-1="Caltrap" data-quantity-1="2"
                    data-charge-2="Octofoil" data-quantity-2="1"        data-charge-3="Escutcheon" data-quantity-3="1"
                    data-charge-4="Quarterly of Eight" data-quantity-4="9">

                <p>
                    These are all interchangable and will be treated the same by the interpreter. For example, if you
                    assign one value to a variable represented by three mullets, assigning another value to a variable 
                    represented by an octofoil will overwrite the variable represented by three mullets. Consider 
                    making your code more "readable" by sticking to one representation, or vary it for aesthetic reasons!

                Whether a number is interpreted as a variable, branch label or numerical value depends on the
                division of the field.
                Output, Arithmetic, and Branching operations all have two possible divisions of the field: one for
                variables, one for numerical values.

                    The statement shown to the right would print the value stored in Variable99 as a character.

                    The statement shown to the right would print the value 99 as a character, which is 'c'.

        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <h4>General Patterns</h4>
        <div class="image-side-by-side">
            <img src="/blazon-docs/assets/arithmetic/example1.png">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Every division of field will have different syntax. Generally, however, the descriptions of fields in 
                    blazon proceeds from top to bottom and from left to right. And no matter what, the blazon will always 
                    begin with a capital letter -- the only one in the blazon -- and end with a period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, field tinctures are specified before all divisions and charges, in a list. The blazon of the 
                    example to the left begins <span style="font-style: italic;">
                        <a href="/blazon-docs/logic/arithmetic#variable-and-number">Per pall</a> argent, 
                    sable, and azure;</span> with descriptions of each charge following the semicolon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the field tinctures are specified ahead of time, then descriptions of each division of the field 
                    follow. In this example these are <span style="font-style: italic;">in chief an anchor, to dexter a 
                    scallop, to sinister two ships</span>. The exact wording of each changes for different divisions of 
                    the field so it is important to consult the documentation to make sure you get it right!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Charges</h4>
        <div class="image-side-by-side">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Finally, charges are required of most divisions and supported on all of them. These will generally,
                    but not always, follow a similar pattern. Examples of how to use each charge, in plural and singular 
                    forms, are given in the <a href="/blazon-docs/design/charges" target="_blank">big list of charges</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, all charges will follow the same pattern:
                    <br>⮚ The field tincture if not specified ahead of time, followed by a comma.
                    <br>⮚ The article "a" or a number of charges "one", "two", or "three"
                    <br>⮚ The name of the charge, pluralized if there are more than one present.
                </p>
